This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Node.js Express.js applications involving unhandled promise rejections within asynchronous route handlers using async/await. The bug showcases a scenario where a database query fails, resulting in an unhandled rejection and causing the server to crash.  The solution provides a robust error-handling mechanism using try...catch blocks to gracefully handle potential database errors and prevent server crashes.
